(*
  Assume that C committed to something.
  The game goes like this:
  1. R starts the game by rejecting C's commitment, and gives a number of steps.
  2. C answers by giving the number of executions steps.
    The number of steps is agreed and it is the min of both.
    Let's say the number of steps = 1000.
  3. R gives h100, h200, h300, ... h1000
  4. C states the first one they disagree with
  5. Repeat 3&4 until we get a single hash or the last one
  6. R gives the proof from h_n to h_n+1 and replays it
  7. We see who was correct between R and C

(* a fork only has effect if:
